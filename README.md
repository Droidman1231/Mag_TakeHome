# Mag_TakeHome
Grant's submission for the MagMutual Take Home Project. The project was written in Python with Sublime Text and tested on Windows 10.

## Instructions:
1. Within a virtual environment, and within the repo (one folder "up" from app), run this command: uvicorn app.main:app --reload

2. You can access the default output at http://127.0.0.1:8000

3. To access the UI, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, and enter "jdoe" into the username parameter for the Lookup User function. The results will then be displayed below

## Questions:
### What did you think of the project?
I liked that I was able to use a language of my choosing, and that the project was created with day-to-day work of this position in mind.

### What didnâ€™t you like about the project?
This is likely a feature, not a bug, but the specifics of the UI were left vague. I am not sure if what I did was sufficient, inadequate, or overkill.

### How would you change the project or approach?
Both of these would increase the workload of the project, but perhaps add an SQL aspect (or variant) if this position will be using SQL a lot. Additionally, additional functions to add, update, and delete additional users could be added.

### Anything else you would like to share?
I don't think so, but feel free to reach out with any questions!
